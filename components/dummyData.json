        "description": "A PBS Great American Read Top 100 Pick One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. From Sauron's fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power spread far and wide. Sauron gathered all the Great Rings to him, but always he searched for the One Ring that would complete his dominion. When Bilbo reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to his young cousin Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom. The Lord of the Rings tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the Wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of Gondor; and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider. This new edition includes the fiftieth-anniversary fully corrected text setting and, for the first time, an extensive new index. J.R.R. Tolkien (1892-1973), beloved throughout the world as the creator of The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion, was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, a fellow of Pembroke College, and a fellow of Merton College until his retirement in 1959. His chief interest was the linguistic aspects of the early English written tradition, but while he studied classic works of the past, he was creating a set of his own.",

In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care. Frodo must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.

This book presents findings from the largest film audience project ever undertaken, drawing from 25,000 questionnaire responses and a wide array of other materials. Contributors use these materials to explore a series of widely speculated questions: why is film fantasy important to different kinds of viewers? Through marketing, previews and reviews, debates and cultural chatter, how are audiences prepared for a film like this? How did fans of the book respond to its adaptation on screen? How do people choose their favorite characters? How was the films' reception shaped by different national and cultural contexts? The answers to these questions shed fresh light on the extraordinary popularity of \"The Lord of the Rings\" and provide important new insights into the global reception of cinema in the twenty-first century.",

        "description": "During The Post-War Years The Experimental Tendency In British Novel Continued, But The Critics Lamented That The Mid-Twentieth Century British Literature Produced No Ulysses. William Golding S Lord Of The Flies (1954) Was Accepted As An Experiment With The Restoration Of Fable In English Fiction, A Reconstruction At An Adult Level Of R.M. Ballantyne S Coral Island. Thanks To The Nobel Prize Awarded To Golding In 1983, Lord Of The Flies Came To The Limelight And Its Underlying Philosophy Has Been Variously Interpreted Since Then. In The Face Of An Upsurge In Golding Criticism, And More Specifically, In Lord Of The Flies, The Novel Demands Fresh Discussions. The Present Book Seeks To Acquaint The Readers First With The Theme Of The Novel, And Then With The Discourses Invited By The Theme.A Detailed Analysis Of Each Of The Chapters Of The Novel Is The Special Attraction Of This Critical Study. It Is Not Just A Summary, But A Critical Analysis Of The Events, Symbols, Images And Reflections Of The Characters Introduced In The Novel. The Chapter-Wise Discussion Will Inspire The Readers To Go Through The Original Text Thoroughly For Having A First Hand Knowledge Of Golding S Art. It Will Also Help The Readers To Develop An Understanding Of Golding As A Novelist Even Before Reading The Original Text.The Chapters On Golding S Concept Of Evil And The Innate Depravity Of Man, Potential Savagery Of Children, Sin And Expiation, The Post-World War Scenario And Elements Of Post-Colonial Writing Are Designed To Project Lord Of The Flies As A Post-Colonial Novel Of Ideas. The Book Also Contains Separate Chapters On Narrative Skill, Characterization, Plot And Structure Which Are Helpful For The Students. The Discussion Is Marked By A Critical Insight That Serves Not Only The Advanced Scholars But Also The Common Students Who Will Be Benefited By The Lucid Presentation.",

        "description": "Peter Jackson's film version of The Lord of the Rings (2001-2003) is the grandest achievement of 21st century cinema so far. But it is also linked to topical and social concerns including war, terrorism, and cultural imperialism. Its style, symbols, narrative, and structure seem always already linked to politics, cultural definition, problems of cinematic style, and the elemenal mythologies that most profoundly capture our imaginations.From Hobbits to Hollywood: Essays on Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings treats Jackson's trilogy as having two conditions of existence: an aesthetic and a political. Like other cultural artefacts, it leads a double life asobjet d'art and public statement about the world, so that nothing in it is ever just cinematically beautiful or tasteful, and nothing is ever just a message or an opinion.Written by leading scholars in the study of cinema and cultureFrom Hobbits to Hollywood gives Jackson's trilogy the fullest scholarly interrogation to date. Ranging from interpretations ofThe Lord of the Rings' ideological and philosophical implications, through discussions of its changing fandoms and its incorporation into the Hollywood industry of stars, technology, genre, and merchandising, to considerations of CGI effects, acting, architecture and style, the essays contained here open a new vista of criticism and light, for ardent fans of J.R.R. Tolkien, followers of Jackson, and all those who yearn for a deeper appreciation of cinema and its relation to culture.",

        "description": "\"This is the best all-around view of the Tolkien phenomenon. Thompson understands the books, she understands the movies—she also understands the money and the franchising. Best of all, she understands the people. Thompson offers cultural criticism of the highest order, examining one of the most significant shifts in contemporary popular media.\"—Tom Shippey, author of The Road to Middle-earth \"Reading these chapters has been an absolute pleasure. It’s all so complex but so succinct. Thompson has managed to do what so many others have failed to do . . . in chapter one, she has explained how all the rights to LOTR bounced around, and were finally sorted so Peter Jackson could make the movie. I’ve never understood the complexities of how that worked until now!\"—Judy Alley, Merchandising Coordinator, The Lord of the Rings \"I must say that Thompson has written the definitive study of Peter Jackson’s work in creating this remarkable production entity.\"—Alex Funke, ASC, Oscar-winning Visual Effects Director of Photography, miniatures unit, The Lord of the Rings \"I had a wonderful time reading those chapters! There’s so much I don’t know about what went on—I am in awe of all the research Thompson has done. It is an extremely interesting read! There’s so much there that I’d forgotten and I always wished there was a permanent record of many things that happened. Thompson’s account of TORN’s beginnings and how it functioned gets it absolutely right—more than that, Thompson captures how it felt to us at the time. Nobody else has managed to get enough of an understanding to do that.\"—Erica Challis (\"Tehanu\"), co-founder of TheOneRing.net",
